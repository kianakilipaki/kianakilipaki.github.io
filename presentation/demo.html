        <h1>CSS Cascade and Inheritance</h1>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Cascading Style Sheets</h2>
            <p>CSS is the abbreviation for <i>Cascading Style Sheets.</i> 
            Which means that CSS rules are read from top to bottom. So,  
            if two selectors are the same, the latter one will be applied. 
            The cascade rule also applies to declarations within the 
            same selector.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="inheritance">
            <h2>Inheritance</h2>
            <p>One of the most uselful things in CSS is that the styles
            can be <b>inherited</b> from the parent element to the child element. 
            This means if I apply a rule to a parent element then that
            same rule will be applied to all of its children elements as well.   
            For example, if I were to make the color of this section 
            red, then all of the elements inside of this section will turn 
            red as well.</p>

            <p>Inheritance makes styling much easier, because without it we 
            would have to style all of the child elements as well as the parent
            elements, which would be annoying. Imagine having to change the font 
            for every single element on your page.</p>

            <p>In some cases the property is not inherited though. Links, for example,  
            will not inherit some properties, like color, because they already 
            have a default color. If you want to change the link color you will 
            have to change it individually. One easy way to fix 
            this is use the keyword <i>inherit.</i> Which will have the selector 
            inherit the property of its parent element.
            <a href="http://www.byui.edu">I am a link!</a></p>

            <p id="border">There are also some properties that cannot be inherited by any
            elements.The border property is not inherited. If it were then we would
            have a border around every element, including links, italics, lists, and 
            so forth which also wouldn't look good. We would have to go through and unstyle
            anything we didn't want a border around.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="specificity-class" id="specificity-id">
            <h2>Specificity</h2>
            <p>Specificity changes the order the rules are read based 
            on how specific the selector is. The list below shows the order of
            specificity, highest to lowest</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Inline styles</li>
                <li>ID selectors</li>
                <li>Class selectors</li>
                <li>Element selectors</li>
                <li>Universal selectors</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Typically, the rule with the highest specificity will win. If two 
            rules have the same specificity then it will win based off of the cascade 
            rule: newer rule gets priority. There is however, a keyword <b>!important</b> 
            which trumps all.</b></p>
